# Web-Report-Vulnerability-Scan
Recommendations in this report are based on the available findings from the phase 3 scanning results. In this process I am going to employ a risk-based, context-aware prioritization method. 
With this method I am going to focus on vulnerabilities that significantly posses higher risk than others. 
This is a tradeoff among a variety of considerations such as severity, fixability, coverage, and compliance.
The plan recommends cost-effective safeguards to mitigate threats and associated exploitable vulnerabilities.
To that end, I would use the same severity ratings I employed in phase 3 to prioritize each remediation action.
